                    <h2>Project 1: Writing Sample 1</h2>
                    <p>This is a sample of the first writing piece. It can be an article, blog post, or essay that demonstrates your writing skills. It's a great way to showcase your work and provide potential clients or employers with a sample of your writing ability.</p>
